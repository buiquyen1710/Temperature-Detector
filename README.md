# Temperature-Detector
Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a smart temperature monitoring device capable of real-time measurement and tracking, applicable in various environments such as educational settings, workplaces, and the agricultural sector. The project focuses on building a practical system utilizing IoT technologies.

Project Overview
This device uses the ESP8266 microcontroller to collect temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor and display it on an OLED screen. The data is then synchronized with Firebase, allowing users to monitor the temperature in real-time remotely via a simple mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor. The app can be accessed through smartphones or computers with internet connectivity.
